# Scala 2 Context Functions

Simulates the syntax of Scala 3 context functions in Scala 2 projects.

## Overview

This library provides a way to use Scala 3's context function syntax (`?=>`) in Scala 2 projects. It implements
type-safe context-dependent functions with proper type inference and composition capabilities, along with comprehensive
cats-compatible type class instances.
